# How to contribute to Think Story

We welcome discussion with our community! Please feel free to:


## Report a bug

Be sure to search through existing issues (both closed AND open), as well as the FAQ in the wiki. If you don't find an answer, open a new issue using the 'Bug report' template. Please be as clear as possible, as it will be difficult to recieve help if people cannot figure out what is going on!


## Request a feature

Be sure to search through existing issues with the 'enhancement' tag, as well as the roadmap. If you don't find a similar request, open a new issue using the 'Feature request' template, clearly describing what your request is.


## Contribute to the documentation

If you feel that some part of the documentation could be made clearer, please either open an issue, open a pull request, or email us a request to update the documentation.


## Contribute to the project

Open a pull request, clearly describing what you have done. 

Coding conventions:
- full tab indentation
- put spaces after list items and method parameters ([a, b, c] instead of [a,b,c]), around operators (y += 10 instead of y+=10)
- generally keep your code clean. If you want your pull requests
